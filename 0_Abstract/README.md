# Abstract:
Door sensor for security purposes are widely used now. An door sensor based on electrical and electronics circuit technology is used to develop the security system as well as automatic light switching system. This security system with door sensor which could benefit every safer environment and single individual. Furthermore, the system is developed with safety environment when switching ON or OFF the light during the room door open or door close.Basically, this system is designed for security purpose to secure the home.

The system which is the designed Home Security using door sensor is designed considering some factors such as economy, availability of components and efficiency, compatibility, portability and also durability.The general operation of this system and performance is dependent on the opening and closing of the door.
# What is a Door Sensor:
The door sensor is an essential component used in-home security system. 
# Working of a Door Sensor:
There are different types of door sensors available in the market. Most of these sensors use a reed switch & a magnet to decide the status of a door whether it is opened or closed. Reed switch is applicable in countless devices like doorbells to laptops which depend on electrical connectors.# 
# Door Sensor Maintenance
Based on the security system, we can able to modify the type of alert we get once a door opens. We may select a clear alarm for sound whenever a door opens. Otherwise, we may choose the alarm to activate mutely while alerting our defense company. No sensor works forever. Because it may get damaged or the switch may wear out. When a door sensor is not working, immediately call to the home security company to change it instantly.


Thus, this is all about the door sensor. From the above information finally, we can conclude that the main features of these sensors mainly include remote control, home security, and wireless installation
