# Introduction:
Door sensors are an essential component of your home security system: they let you know when someone is entering your home. These devices are made up of two parts, which form a circuit when they're kept parallel to each other.

This Project developed  in embedded c as  Door Sensor for home protection Door sensors for home are an important component of your home protection system In this embeded project you know home protection by using home densors and know the status of Door whether open or close. In this embedded project the components are used LED's and voltimeter,and fixed voltage in this project iam used 10v. If the LED  is glow bright that means the status of the door is open. If the door is close the status of the door is close.

# Research:
Installing door sensors:
Door sensors are easy to install. Using a strong adhesive, attach one piece of the sensor onto the door and the other to the frame.

The two pieces must sit directly next to each other with only a small amount of space between them. If they’re too far away or aren’t parallel to one another, the pieces can’t interact and the reed switch and magnet won’t create a circuit.

Home door sensor's play vital role so Homedoor sensor's used widely the circuit becomes simple and easy maintanance required And also these system is stable and efficient. Used the components are LED's and Atmega328,connecting wires and voltimeter and voltage we are used 10v.
The LED glows bright the door status is open and the LED glows close the door status is close.

# Cost and Features:
 * complexity
 * Defining our system
 * system defination

# 4'W and 1'H:-
# What :-
  * Home door sensor play a key role for secure the home know the details about door is open or close.
# Why :-
  * Home door sensor importaant why because know the details of door and save energy savings.
# When :-
  * Home door sensors used 24hours becomes knowing the status of doors.
# Who :-
  * Everyone use home door sensors because they keep the house securely.
# How :-
  * The frame attaches to the door when it opens one frame move distance from parallel frame attaches to the door result know the status of door open or close.
# Strength:-
 * 1.Lesser maintenance
 * 2.No major installation required
 * 3.Safeguards family and kids
# Weakness:-
 * 1.circuit may damage exeeding of voltage
 * 2.Discharge of batteries

 * 2.Advancements in Technology
 
 # High level requirements
* | ID  |                      	Discription	                      |         status      |
* |ID_01|	    User know  status about door  either open or closed	|        Implemented  |
* |ID_02|    kow Door Status using LED                            |       	Implemented  |

# Low level requirements:-

* |ID    |   	              Discription	   |     result          |  status     |
* |ID_01	|  Gets Indication of Open Door   |     High LED        | Implemented |
* |ID_02	|  Gets Indication of Closed Door |     Low LED         |Implemented  |
