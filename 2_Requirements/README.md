# Introduction:
Door sensors are an essential component of your home security system: they let you know when someone is entering your home. These devices are made up of two parts, which form a circuit when they're kept parallel to each other.

This Project developed  in embedded c as  Door Sensor for home protection Door sensors for home are an important component of your home protection system In this embeded project you know home protection by using home densors and know the status of Door whether open or close. In this embedded project the components are used LED's and voltimeter,and fixed voltage in this project iam used 10v. If the LED  is glow bright that means the status of the door is open. If the door is close the status of the door is close.

# Research:
Installing door sensors:
Door sensors are easy to install. Using a strong adhesive, attach one piece of the sensor onto the door and the other to the frame.

The two pieces must sit directly next to each other with only a small amount of space between them. If they’re too far away or aren’t parallel to one another, the pieces can’t interact and the reed switch and magnet won’t create a circuit.

Home door sensor's play vital role so Homedoor sensor's used widely the circuit becomes simple and easy maintanance required And also these system is stable and efficient. Used the components are LED's and Atmega328,connecting wires and voltimeter and voltage we are used 10v.
The LED glows bright the door status is open and the LED glows close the door status is close.

# 4'W and 1'H:-
# What :-
  * Door sensors are an essential component of your home security system: they let you know about the Door which is open or closed.
# Why :-
  * In order to get door status that if door is open then we can assume that someone is entering or going out.
# When :-
  * Anytime we can use this sensors as this are automatic door sensors which are connected to door to get the status of door.
# Who :-
  * All the peoples those who want to keep their Home secure With this Door Sensors which are easy to Install.
# How :-
  * One piece attaches on the door frame, and the other attaches parallel to the first piece on the door itself.
   these two parts creats close circuit when door is close and when door is open it will switch circuit.

# Strength:-
 * 1.Lesser maintenance
 * 2.No major installation required
 * 3.Safeguards family and kids
# Weakness:-
 * 1.circuit may damage exeeding of voltage
 * 2.Discharge of batteries
# Opportunities:-
 * 2.Advancements in Technology
